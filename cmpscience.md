# IP Address.
```
An IP address, or Internet Protocol address, is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves as an identifier for devices, allowing them to send and receive data over the internet or a local network.

  IP addresses provide a way for devices to locate and communicate with each other.

  They act like digital addresses that help direct data packets to their intended destinations.

   When you visit a website, send an email, or perform any online activity, your device uses its IP
     address to establish connections and exchange data with other devices or servers.

# VPN.
```
A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is a technology that allows you to establish a secure and encrypted connection over the internet. 

It creates a private network connection between your device and a VPN server, encrypting your internet traffic and routing it through the server before reaching its destination.
